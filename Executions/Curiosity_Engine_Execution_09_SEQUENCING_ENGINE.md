# PARENT LOOP — EXECUTION GOAL

## Main Goal

Deliver the **Sequencing Engine** as one coherent, repository-native capability for the Personal Terminal Edition. Every Child Loop must reach `YES`, the integrated engine must preserve shared contracts and local-first/provider-neutral invariants, and fresh final-state verification must support the complete Goal.

This is not a design-only task. The result must be usable code, tests, configuration, migration/state behavior where applicable, and concise operator documentation.

## Parent Loop State Machine

`BASELINE → CHILD PLAN → CHILD EXECUTE → CHILD VERIFY → CHILD REVIEW → CHILD GOAL GATE → NEXT CHILD → INTEGRATION REVIEW → FINAL VERIFY → PARENT GOAL GATE → REPORT`

On material failure:

`FAILURE → REPRODUCE → ROOT-CAUSE / EVIDENCE REVIEW → REVISED PLAN → REPAIR → RE-VERIFY → RE-REVIEW`

Do not skip forward to manufacture a positive completion narrative.

# EXECUTION CONTRACT — APPLIES TO THIS FILE

Read and apply, when present:
1. `Product Definition.md`
2. `Shared Architecture Contract.md`
3. `Execution Contract.md`
4. `Parallel Execution Protocol.md`
5. `Research Basis.md`
6. repository `AGENTS.md` and scoped instructions.

### Repository-first
Inspect the real repository, worktree, existing owners, tests, dependencies, and prior implementation before adding code.

### Context engineering
Build a bounded context ledger: `VERIFIED / OBSERVED / INFERRED / UNKNOWN`. Retrieve targeted context; do not fill the context window with irrelevant repository text. Preserve durable decisions in code/contracts/tests.

### Prompt discipline
Treat requirements as testable contracts. Explicitly map requirement → owner → implementation → evidence. Do not silently weaken a requirement because implementation is inconvenient.

### Harness engineering
Prefer deterministic commands, fixtures, fake adapters, stable IDs, idempotent operations, timeouts, budgets, structured diagnostics, and one-command verification. Maintain provider-neutral behavior.

### Parallel safety
Respect this Execution's canonical write scope. If a shared contract must change, serialize that change and update contract tests; do not create a local shadow contract.

### Anti-hallucination / no-sycophancy
Never invent current API behavior, test results, files, schemas, or completion. Agreement is not evidence.

### Efficiency
No AI inference or remote fetch may be placed in the 10-second display tick. Deduplicate/cache before expensive work.

### Verification
No success claim is valid without fresh verification after the final relevant edit.

## Engine Invariants

- Local-first single-user release.
- No commercial/account/billing/cloud multi-tenant infrastructure.
- No GraphRAG or dedicated graph database.
- No mandatory external vector database.
- Provider-specific code remains behind adapters.
- Raw source/evidence truth is not mutated by derived knowledge or presentation layers.
- Remote text is untrusted and must not execute.
- The frozen browser/source-click pause/resume feature remains out of scope.

# PARENT LOOP — BASELINE GATE

Before Child Loop 1:

- inspect `git status`, branch/worktree state, root instructions, package configuration, migrations, tests, and existing architecture;
- verify that declared dependency Executions are actually present in repository reality; do not trust a report alone;
- locate canonical owners relevant to ``src/curiosity/sequencing/`, sequencing tests`;
- identify pre-existing failures that could contaminate verification;
- inspect external API/library docs only when current behavior materially affects this execution;
- record any shared-contract conflict before implementation.

### Parent Baseline Questions

- What proves the dependency baseline?
- Which module currently owns this engine's responsibility?
- Which public/domain contracts must remain stable?
- Which unrelated user changes must be preserved?
- What is the highest-risk false assumption?
- What would make it dishonest or unsafe to continue?

Do not ask the user for facts the repository or authoritative documentation can answer.

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 1: Implement Session Queue Planner

## Task Source Requirement

The 10-second runtime consumes a precomputed local queue. The planner—not the renderer—owns ordering decisions.

Required outcomes:

- Plan a bounded queue ahead of display using ranked candidates and sequence packets.
- Represent why each queue item was chosen and any sequence continuity constraint.
- Keep queue generation local and bounded; no LLM/network fetch during planning unless an explicit refresh command runs outside playback.
- Support configurable interval/session size/mode.
- Persist queue/session identity so restart can continue without replaying the same first items.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Session Queue Planner** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Session Queue Planner** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

## Phase A — Ground Truth / Context

Before coding:
- inspect current implementation, callers, tests, configuration, persistence, migrations, and external boundaries relevant to this Task;
- verify predecessors and current API/library behavior when version-sensitive;
- identify canonical owners and consumers;
- classify material findings `VERIFIED / OBSERVED / INFERRED / HYPOTHESIZED / UNKNOWN`;
- establish the smallest context set needed for a defensible plan;
- identify pre-existing failures;
- search for existing code before adding dependencies or abstractions.

Do not edit implementation code until enough evidence exists for a defensible plan.

## Phase B — Deep Questions That Must Be Answered

1. What is VERIFIED from the repository now, what is only required by this Execution, what is INFERRED, and what remains UNKNOWN?
2. Who currently owns this responsibility, and is there an existing partial/duplicate/legacy implementation to reuse, repair, migrate, or remove?
3. Which assumption would most damage correctness if false, and what evidence can falsify it before implementation?
4. What could look complete while still passing only narrow happy-path tests?
5. Which identity, persistence, concurrency, privacy, trust, compatibility, or recovery boundary can this change accidentally violate?
6. What final-state evidence is required to prove the Goal without trusting the implementing agent's narrative?
7. Can any model call, network call, new dependency, abstraction, or persistent state be removed while preserving the Goal?
8. What happens when the external dependency is slow, malformed, unavailable, rate-limited, or returns partial data?
9. What must be idempotent so rerunning after interruption does not duplicate work or cost?
10. Which data is authoritative, which is derived, and where could the implementation accidentally collapse that distinction?
11. What is the smallest end-to-end implementation that is actually usable instead of a disconnected framework or set of types?
12. Which negative/adversarial case is most likely to falsify the claim that this Child is complete?

## Phase C — Plan Mode

Create an evidence-based plan before editing.

The plan must:
- map every material requirement to files/owners and expected evidence;
- identify what is reused, extended, replaced, or removed;
- identify data/provenance/idempotency/failure/compatibility invariants;
- define tests before implementation;
- include migration/restart/recovery behavior when state changes;
- include budget/timeouts for remote/model work;
- remain the smallest coherent plan.

### Plan Challenge

Attempt to falsify the plan:
- Does it depend on an unverified API or library behavior?
- Does it create a second source of truth?
- Does it place expensive work on an interactive path?
- Does it omit partial failure/restart/idempotency?
- Does it make an optional provider mandatory?
- Does it create a framework without a complete user-visible path?
- Would a simpler extension of a canonical owner achieve the Goal?

Revise the plan if challenged successfully.

## Phase D — Execute

Implement the plan.

- Deliver working behavior, not TODOs or disconnected types.
- Keep authoritative source/evidence separate from derived/presentation data.
- Validate all external/provider payloads.
- Apply bounded concurrency, timeouts, retry policies, and budgets.
- Keep changes within the canonical scope except strictly necessary contract/integration changes.
- If a predecessor is incomplete, repair only the minimum safe prerequisite or expose the blocker truthfully.
- Do not add speculative extensibility whose first consumer does not exist.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- Planner creates a valid queue from fixture corpus/profile.
- No network/provider mock is invoked by queue planning.
- Restart fixture resumes from persisted session/queue position.
- Reason codes survive queue persistence.

Also:
- run lint/format/type/static checks configured for the repository;
- run focused unit and integration tests;
- run at least one negative/adversarial case;
- rerun the strongest relevant checks after the last code edit;
- inspect actual outputs when claims concern provenance, ordering, persistence, deduplication, budgets, or terminal behavior.

For each material claim, state what the evidence proves and what it does not prove.

## Phase F — Review

### Goal/Spec Review
Compare the final diff and evidence clause-by-clause against this Task requirement. Search for omitted clauses, silently weakened behavior, accidental ownership shifts, and unsupported completion claims.

### Engineering Review
Inspect callers, data transitions, error handling, concurrency, resource limits, security/privacy, performance, compatibility, tests, dead code, duplicate ownership, and migration/restart behavior.

Prefer a fresh-context reviewer/subagent when supported, with bounded scope and no authority to mutate unrelated modules.

## Phase G — Repair Loop

If verification/review fails:
1. do not advance;
2. reproduce;
3. determine verified root cause or preserve uncertainty;
4. revise the same Task plan;
5. apply the smallest responsible repair;
6. re-run verification and both reviews;
7. repeat until `YES` or a genuine external blocker remains.

Do not stack speculative patches.

## Phase H — Child Final Goal Gate

**HAVE WE ACHIEVED THE FINAL GOAL FOR TASK 1? — YES / PARTIALLY / NO**

Advance only on `YES`.

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 2: Implement Continuity vs Exploration Policy

## Task Source Requirement

A good session sometimes stays with one mini-sequence and sometimes changes topic. The policy should be explicit and testable.

Required outcomes:

- Honor sequence packet order once a packet is chosen unless a hard exclusion invalidates it.
- Cap sequence length and consecutive-topic streak.
- Interleave independent cards according to profile/diversity policy.
- Avoid ending every session on the same high-score source/topic due to deterministic tie behavior.
- Provide seeded tie-breaking.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Continuity vs Exploration Policy** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Continuity vs Exploration Policy** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

## Phase A — Ground Truth / Context

- Do not add speculative extensibility whose first consumer does not exist.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- Sequence fixture remains ordered.
- Diversity cap fixture interrupts excessive same-topic streak.
- Tie-breaking is deterministic under seed and varied across seeds.
- Excluded/rejected card never appears in final queue.

Also:
- run lint/format/type/static checks configured for the repository;
- run focused unit and integration tests;
- run at least one negative/adversarial case;

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 3: Implement Queue Refill, Exhaustion, and Staleness Rules

## Task Source Requirement

Playback must remain smooth as content is consumed or source state changes.

Required outcomes:

- Refill before queue exhaustion outside the display tick using local store candidates.
- Define behavior when corpus is too small: controlled repetition, pause with message, or request refresh—never tight loop.
- Invalidate queued cards if verification/status changes before display.
- Do not regenerate/reverify synchronously at the moment of display.
- Expose queue diagnostics for `curiosity doctor`/debug.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Queue Refill, Exhaustion, and Staleness Rules** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Queue Refill, Exhaustion, and Staleness Rules** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- Tiny-corpus fixture follows declared exhaustion behavior without CPU spin.
- Card invalidated after queue creation is skipped safely.
- Refill keeps display path free of remote/model calls.
- Queue diagnostics identify why content is unavailable.

- verify dependency direction and contract compatibility;
- search duplicate owners and stale paths;
- inspect local-startup and restart behavior;
- inspect cost/latency/resource implications;
- confirm no commercial/frozen feature leaked into scope;
