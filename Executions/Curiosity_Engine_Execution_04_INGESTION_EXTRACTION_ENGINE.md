# PARENT LOOP — EXECUTION GOAL

## Main Goal

Deliver the **Ingestion & Extraction Engine** as one coherent, repository-native capability for the Personal Terminal Edition. Every Child Loop must reach `YES`, the integrated engine must preserve shared contracts and local-first/provider-neutral invariants, and fresh final-state verification must support the complete Goal.

This is not a design-only task. The result must be usable code, tests, configuration, migration/state behavior where applicable, and concise operator documentation.

## Parent Loop State Machine

`BASELINE → CHILD PLAN → CHILD EXECUTE → CHILD VERIFY → CHILD REVIEW → CHILD GOAL GATE → NEXT CHILD → INTEGRATION REVIEW → FINAL VERIFY → PARENT GOAL GATE → REPORT`

On material failure:

`FAILURE → REPRODUCE → ROOT-CAUSE / EVIDENCE REVIEW → REVISED PLAN → REPAIR → RE-VERIFY → RE-REVIEW`

Do not skip forward to manufacture a positive completion narrative.

# EXECUTION CONTRACT — APPLIES TO THIS FILE

Read and apply, when present:
1. `Product Definition.md`
2. `Shared Architecture Contract.md`
3. `Execution Contract.md`
4. `Parallel Execution Protocol.md`
5. `Research Basis.md`
6. repository `AGENTS.md` and scoped instructions.

### Repository-first
Inspect the real repository, worktree, existing owners, tests, dependencies, and prior implementation before adding code.

### Context engineering
Build a bounded context ledger: `VERIFIED / OBSERVED / INFERRED / UNKNOWN`. Retrieve targeted context; do not fill the context window with irrelevant repository text. Preserve durable decisions in code/contracts/tests.

### Prompt discipline
Treat requirements as testable contracts. Explicitly map requirement → owner → implementation → evidence. Do not silently weaken a requirement because implementation is inconvenient.

### Harness engineering
Prefer deterministic commands, fixtures, fake adapters, stable IDs, idempotent operations, timeouts, budgets, structured diagnostics, and one-command verification. Maintain provider-neutral behavior.

### Parallel safety
Respect this Execution's canonical write scope. If a shared contract must change, serialize that change and update contract tests; do not create a local shadow contract.

### Anti-hallucination / no-sycophancy
Never invent current API behavior, test results, files, schemas, or completion. Agreement is not evidence.

### Efficiency
No AI inference or remote fetch may be placed in the 10-second display tick. Deduplicate/cache before expensive work.

### Verification
No success claim is valid without fresh verification after the final relevant edit.

## Engine Invariants

- Local-first single-user release.
- No commercial/account/billing/cloud multi-tenant infrastructure.
- No GraphRAG or dedicated graph database.
- No mandatory external vector database.
- Provider-specific code remains behind adapters.
- Raw source/evidence truth is not mutated by derived knowledge or presentation layers.
- Remote text is untrusted and must not execute.
- The frozen browser/source-click pause/resume feature remains out of scope.

# PARENT LOOP — BASELINE GATE

Before Child Loop 1:

- inspect `git status`, branch/worktree state, root instructions, package configuration, migrations, tests, and existing architecture;
- verify that declared dependency Executions are actually present in repository reality; do not trust a report alone;
- locate canonical owners relevant to ``src/curiosity/ingest/`, parser adapters, ingestion fixtures/tests`;
- identify pre-existing failures that could contaminate verification;
- inspect external API/library docs only when current behavior materially affects this execution;
- record any shared-contract conflict before implementation.

### Parent Baseline Questions

- What proves the dependency baseline?
- Which module currently owns this engine's responsibility?
- Which public/domain contracts must remain stable?
- Which unrelated user changes must be preserved?
- What is the highest-risk false assumption?
- What would make it dishonest or unsafe to continue?

Do not ask the user for facts the repository or authoritative documentation can answer.

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 1: Implement Conditional Fetching, Cache Reuse, and Content Identity

## Task Source Requirement

Repeated ingestion must avoid refetching and reprocessing unchanged content. GitHub and other HTTP sources should use ETag/Last-Modified when supported and content hashes everywhere.

Required outcomes:

- Implement bounded HTTP fetcher with conditional request headers sourced from store metadata.
- Treat 304 as cache reuse and avoid downstream parsing/model work when parser/version inputs are unchanged.
- Enforce byte limits, MIME allowlist, redirect limit, decompression safety, timeout, and cancellation.
- Compute raw and normalized content hashes where appropriate.
- Persist failure classification and retry schedule through durable jobs.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Conditional Fetching, Cache Reuse, and Content Identity** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Conditional Fetching, Cache Reuse, and Content Identity** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

## Phase A — Ground Truth / Context

Before coding:
- inspect current implementation, callers, tests, configuration, persistence, migrations, and external boundaries relevant to this Task;
- verify predecessors and current API/library behavior when version-sensitive;
- identify canonical owners and consumers;
- classify material findings `VERIFIED / OBSERVED / INFERRED / HYPOTHESIZED / UNKNOWN`;
- establish the smallest context set needed for a defensible plan;
- identify pre-existing failures;
- search for existing code before adding dependencies or abstractions.

Do not edit implementation code until enough evidence exists for a defensible plan.

## Phase B — Deep Questions That Must Be Answered

1. What is VERIFIED from the repository now, what is only required by this Execution, what is INFERRED, and what remains UNKNOWN?
2. Who currently owns this responsibility, and is there an existing partial/duplicate/legacy implementation to reuse, repair, migrate, or remove?
3. Which assumption would most damage correctness if false, and what evidence can falsify it before implementation?
4. What could look complete while still passing only narrow happy-path tests?
5. Which identity, persistence, concurrency, privacy, trust, compatibility, or recovery boundary can this change accidentally violate?
6. What final-state evidence is required to prove the Goal without trusting the implementing agent's narrative?
7. Can any model call, network call, new dependency, abstraction, or persistent state be removed while preserving the Goal?
8. What happens when the external dependency is slow, malformed, unavailable, rate-limited, or returns partial data?
9. What must be idempotent so rerunning after interruption does not duplicate work or cost?
10. Which data is authoritative, which is derived, and where could the implementation accidentally collapse that distinction?
11. What is the smallest end-to-end implementation that is actually usable instead of a disconnected framework or set of types?
12. Which negative/adversarial case is most likely to falsify the claim that this Child is complete?

## Phase C — Plan Mode

Create an evidence-based plan before editing.

The plan must:
- map every material requirement to files/owners and expected evidence;
- identify what is reused, extended, replaced, or removed;
- identify data/provenance/idempotency/failure/compatibility invariants;
- define tests before implementation;
- include migration/restart/recovery behavior when state changes;
- include budget/timeouts for remote/model work;
- remain the smallest coherent plan.

### Plan Challenge

Attempt to falsify the plan:
- Does it depend on an unverified API or library behavior?
- Does it create a second source of truth?
- Does it place expensive work on an interactive path?
- Does it omit partial failure/restart/idempotency?
- Does it make an optional provider mandatory?
- Does it create a framework without a complete user-visible path?
- Would a simpler extension of a canonical owner achieve the Goal?

Revise the plan if challenged successfully.

## Phase D — Execute

Implement the plan.

- Deliver working behavior, not TODOs or disconnected types.
- Keep authoritative source/evidence separate from derived/presentation data.
- Validate all external/provider payloads.
- Apply bounded concurrency, timeouts, retry policies, and budgets.
- Keep changes within the canonical scope except strictly necessary contract/integration changes.
- If a predecessor is incomplete, repair only the minimum safe prerequisite or expose the blocker truthfully.
- Do not add speculative extensibility whose first consumer does not exist.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- 200 then 304 fixture proves second run avoids duplicate body processing.
- Oversize body, redirect loop, timeout, wrong MIME, and truncated response fail safely.
- Same content from repeated discovery does not create duplicate documents.
- Interrupted fetch/job can resume without duplicate final records.

Also:
- run lint/format/type/static checks configured for the repository;
- run focused unit and integration tests;
- run at least one negative/adversarial case;
- rerun the strongest relevant checks after the last code edit;
- inspect actual outputs when claims concern provenance, ordering, persistence, deduplication, budgets, or terminal behavior.

For each material claim, state what the evidence proves and what it does not prove.

## Phase F — Review

### Goal/Spec Review
Compare the final diff and evidence clause-by-clause against this Task requirement. Search for omitted clauses, silently weakened behavior, accidental ownership shifts, and unsupported completion claims.

### Engineering Review
Inspect callers, data transitions, error handling, concurrency, resource limits, security/privacy, performance, compatibility, tests, dead code, duplicate ownership, and migration/restart behavior.

Prefer a fresh-context reviewer/subagent when supported, with bounded scope and no authority to mutate unrelated modules.

## Phase G — Repair Loop

If verification/review fails:
1. do not advance;
2. reproduce;
3. determine verified root cause or preserve uncertainty;
4. revise the same Task plan;
5. apply the smallest responsible repair;
6. re-run verification and both reviews;
7. repeat until `YES` or a genuine external blocker remains.

Do not stack speculative patches.

## Phase H — Child Final Goal Gate

**HAVE WE ACHIEVED THE FINAL GOAL FOR TASK 1? — YES / PARTIALLY / NO**

Advance only on `YES`.

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 2: Implement Web and Document Parsers with Provenance

## Task Source Requirement

Use Trafilatura for main webpage extraction and Docling for PDFs/complex documents. Preserve parser/version/source provenance and never execute embedded content.

Required outcomes:

- Trafilatura adapter extracts main text and metadata from already-fetched bounded HTML.
- Docling adapter converts supported local/downloaded documents through an isolated parser boundary.
- Parser selection is based on validated MIME/format, not only filename extension.
- Preserve section/headings/page or location metadata where parser exposes it.
- Do not OCR/process huge media by default; expensive modes require explicit config/budget.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Web and Document Parsers with Provenance** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Web and Document Parsers with Provenance** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

- If a predecessor is incomplete, repair only the minimum safe prerequisite or expose the blocker truthfully.
- Do not add speculative extensibility whose first consumer does not exist.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- Representative HTML fixture removes navigation noise while retaining main content.
- Representative PDF fixture yields structured text with provenance.
- Malformed document/parser failure is isolated and does not corrupt existing records.
- Remote embedded scripts/macros/code are never executed.

Also:
- run lint/format/type/static checks configured for the repository;
- run focused unit and integration tests;
- run at least one negative/adversarial case;
- rerun the strongest relevant checks after the last code edit;

Advance only on `YES`.

# CHILD LOOP — TASK 3: Implement Deterministic Chunking and Ingestion Pipeline

## Task Source Requirement

Knowledge extraction needs bounded source regions. Chunking must be deterministic enough for evidence identity and cost control.

Required outcomes:

- Chunk by semantic/structural boundaries first, bounded by configurable token/character ceiling.
- Preserve chunk ordinal, section path, document reference, hashes, and offsets where available.
- Deduplicate identical/near-identical normalized chunks before expensive model work using deterministic text normalization/hash; optional similarity is secondary.
- Implement durable stage progression: discovered → fetched → parsed → chunked → ready.
- Expose `curiosity ingest` with bounded source/doc counts and resumable behavior.

## Objective

Implement **Implement Deterministic Chunking and Ingestion Pipeline** as a coherent capability integrated with canonical owners. Preserve the functional intent above while adapting details to verified repository architecture.

## Final Goal for This Child Loop

An independent reviewer can inspect the final repository and fresh evidence and conclude that **Implement Deterministic Chunking and Ingestion Pipeline** works end-to-end, handles the stated failure boundaries, preserves shared architecture contracts, and leaves no unjustified duplicate ownership or placeholder-only implementation.

- Do not add speculative extensibility whose first consumer does not exist.

## Phase E — Verification

Fresh final-state evidence must include:

- Chunking same document/version twice yields stable identities/order.
- Oversize sections split without losing provenance.
- Duplicate chunks avoid duplicate downstream jobs.
- CLI interruption/restart resumes from durable stage rather than restarting all work.

Also:
- run lint/format/type/static checks configured for the repository;

# PARENT INTEGRATION REVIEW

After all Child Loops reach `YES`:

- inspect the full engine diff as one unit;
- verify dependency direction and contract compatibility;
- search duplicate owners and stale paths;
- inspect local-startup and restart behavior;
- inspect cost/latency/resource implications;
- confirm no commercial/frozen feature leaked into scope;
- confirm optional dependencies fail soft where required;
- run contract/regression tests for neighboring engines touched.

# FINAL VERIFY

Run the strongest repository-native final-state suite applicable to this engine, including a clean or representative integration path.

Additional engine acceptance requirements:

- A GitHub README/web article/research PDF fixture can each reach normalized chunks with source provenance.
- A repeated unchanged ingest performs materially less work and no duplicate downstream jobs.
- No parser/fetch operation occurs in the display loop.

# PARENT GOAL GATE
